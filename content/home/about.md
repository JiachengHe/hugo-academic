# Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at University of Kansas. 

I am an applied microeconomist. I exploit natural experiments and use design-based microeconometric methods (e.g. regression discontinuity, difference in difference, event study, and synthetic control) to identify and estimate causal effects. I also use machine learning and natural language processing techniques to extract useful and interesting information from text data.

In my daily research activity, I am heavily addicted to RStudio, Git Bash, Ubuntu for Windows, Jupyter Notebook, and iced Americano.
