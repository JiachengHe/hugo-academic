# Welcome!

I am an applied microeconomist with strong data science and causal inference skills. 

I use design-based microeconometric methods (e.g. regression discontinuity, difference in difference, event study, and synthetic control) and natural experiments to identify and estimate causal effects. I also use machine learning and computational linguistic techniques to extract useful and interesting information from text data.

In my daily research activity, I am heavily addicted to RStudio, Jupyter Notebook, Git, Ubuntu, and iced Americano.

Recently I have been studying the role of asset test in public health insurance programs, as well as the local labor market impact of routine biased technological change. I am also a participant in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dg040301) competitions.

Here is my {{% staticref "files/cv/CV.pdf" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}}. You can find my projects in my [GitHub](https://github.com/JiachengHe).
