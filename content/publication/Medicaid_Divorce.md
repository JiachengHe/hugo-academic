abstract = "To get a divorce, split the joint assets, and allocate most of the assets to the healthy spouse is a strategy to help the sick spouse financially qualify for Medicaid coverage. The exogenous age-based increase in eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid reduces the incentive for people crossing the 65-threshold to implement Medicaid divorce. Using regression discontinuity design, I estimate a 4.1 percent discrete decrease in the prevalence of divorce at the 65-threshold. By examining how the magnitude of the divorce gap is associated with the state-level variation in Medicaid asset test, I argue that the divorce gap at age 65 measures the reduction in Medicaid divorce. In addition, the heterogeneity analysis indicates that the divorce gap is significantly larger for women, which suggests that Medicaid divorce is more prevalent when the sick spouse is the wife."
